# Datahack 2024

## Overview
This repository contains the code and data used for the Datahack 2024 project. The project involves analyzing a dataset and applying machine learning techniques to derive insights and make predictions. On comparing various classicification models woz. Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector machine, ROC obtained for Random Forest Classifier was highest. The preprocsessing was performed using OneHotEncoder. 'Mean Data' respecte to each coloumn was used to fillin missing values.
